In our project proposal, we layed out a bunch of functionality that unfortunately, we didn't get to implement.  This was due to a few factors.  The first was that we had originally planned to use an Azure SQL database instead of a MongoDB database.  We had layed out all of our tables in Azure and got them to a satisfactory point, however, when we were looking into how to connect Java to an Azure database, we got stuck.  We tried for a few days to figure it out, but nothing worked.  In the end we decided to use the template from Software Design and Development and adapt it to work with our data.
